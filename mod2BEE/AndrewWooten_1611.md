Hey Future Mod 2 Student,

  You're gonna have a great time! Don't doubt yourself.
There's a few things you can do to make life a little
simpler as you enter Mod 2.
  If you haven't yet, get your work organized. There
are a lot of repos that get cloned down that are referenced
and that you'll find yourself re-referencing multiple times.
Have these put into say a 'classwork' folder in Mod 2
directory. Being able to pull these up with minimal
effort will make life easier on you.
  Speaking of repos, if you're not effective at forking
and/or cloning repos then get on that. You'll spend
more class time focused on content/exercises and
less cursing GitHub. Take some time to practice cloning
things down. The Turing School repo is pretty massive,
so dig through and find some interesting things to clone
down.
  Get a bash profile together and build in some
personal shortcuts to make getting around your machine
through your terminal easier. Typing in the entire path
to get to a heavily nested/often-used folder is a pain; save yourself
this utter inconvenience.
  As far as content goes, as of now Mod 2 contains
several well-guided tutorial projects. These are awesome!
Front-load your work and take your time going through these.
You'll absorb more and help yourself build understanding
of the concepts. If you rush through and do a lot of
copy and paste work, you're shooting yourself in the
foot. Don't do it! The tutorials are also a good place
to run some experiments; see if you can take a small idea
and make it work.
  Whatever your text editor of choice is, dig through and
find shortcuts to make your your life that much simpler.
You'll be able to work faster/more effectively. You
can explore the documentation for your editor, but there's
some pretty great YouTube videos on the subject for the
heavy-hitter editors: Atom, VS Code, etc.
  It's gonna be a great time in Mod 2. If you need help,
reach out to anyone in the community for assistance. We
all want to see each other succeed and are happy to help out.
Good Luck!

Andrew
